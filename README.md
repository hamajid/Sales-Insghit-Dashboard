# Sales Dashboard

## Tableau or Power BI?
In this project, I tried to create two similar dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, to show that if you know one BI tool it will be easy for you to learn and use the second one. Of course, each one has its own Pros and Cons, but in general both have similar basic functionalities.
This GitHub repository contains data extracted from a sales database, and two dashboards, one created using Tableau and second one using Power BI.

## About the Data 

This data is extracted from a sales database, It has three main files (Order, Customer and Product). I changed the real products names to Product 00X and the real customers name to Customer 00X.

- **Customer Excel File.**
- **Orders Excel File.**
- **Product Excel File.**

## Power BI Dashboard

I created a basic dashboard to analyze the revenue and the profit, I kept it as simple as possible, and for best practice, I added the measures as a separate table.

## Tableau Dashboard
	
I tried to make the tableau dashboard looks like the Power BI one.
